MYFIND is a c program that copies the function "find" in bash.

To build the program, just run the command "make" or "make all".
To delete the program, just run "make clean".

You can then call the program by typing "./myfind" followed by
your arguments.

You can also run automated tests by typing "make check"
(this will compile the program if it wasn't already built).

Usage :

-./myfind <options> <path(s)> <expressions>

--> Option can be any of the following (0 or many) :

    <-[dHLP]>

--> Expression can be any of the following (0 or many) :

    <-name "<pattern>"> <-type [bcdflps]> <-print> <-exec <command>\;>

note: see man page of 'find' for more information
